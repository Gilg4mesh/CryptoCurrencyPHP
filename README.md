# CryptoCurrencyPHP

A collection of common utilities and libraries in PHP for use with Bitcoin and Zetacoin compatable crypto currencies ustilizing the secp256k ECDSA curve.

I doubt most of this works at the moment since I'm still pulling things together.  The current (planned) features include:

- Message Signing and verification
- Address Generation and Validation
- Address compression, de-compression, enconding, and de-enconding.

Based on work by Jan Moritz Lindemann, Matyas Danter, and Joey Hewitt
